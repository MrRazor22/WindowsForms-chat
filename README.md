# WindowsForms-chat (.NET Framework 4.8 Port)

This project is a .NET Framework 4.8 port of the original [winforms-chat](https://github.com/agreentejada/winforms-chat) application.

The original project was built using .NET Core, which may not be compatible with legacy Windows applications. This port ensures compatibility with older systems that rely on the .NET Framework runtime.
